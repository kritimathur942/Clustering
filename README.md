# Clustering
These are the two types of clustering that I performed on a large data set, moreover in hierarchical clustering there is further division between Agglomerative and Divisive and I have focused on Agglomerative in this file. Both the projects use 3 basic libraries and scikit learn and scipy both used for machine learning purposes. 

funny fact: I types scipy as spicy and kept wondering why does it keep showing error that spicy doesn't exists when I even installed it, took me a lot of time to realise what I was doing wrong.
